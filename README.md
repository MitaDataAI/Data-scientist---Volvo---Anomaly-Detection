# Internship at Volvo 

# Volvo 
Volvo is a world leader in car safety, sustainability, and innovation. It created the three-point seatbelt in 1959 and still leads in safety technology today. Volvo wants no one to be killed or seriously hurt in a new Volvo car. The company also cares about the environment. It plans to sell only electric cars by 2030 and be climate-neutral by 2040. Volvo Group, which makes trucks and buses, is a leader in heavy vehicles and is working on electric and self-driving transport. Volvo is known around the world for making safe, reliable, and responsible vehicles.

# Goal of the project
Volvo’s motto, “For life,” reflects its strong commitment to quality and durability—a philosophy shared by its subsidiary, Renault Trucks. Known for innovation, Renault Trucks performs rigorous tests on its vehicles, including electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests in a Faraday chamber to ensure the reliability of electronic systems. Since 2010, the tool Observer has been used to monitor CAN network signals during these tests. The current version, Observer 2.0, detects anomalies using predefined Min-Max rules.

However, it has limitations: it relies heavily on expert knowledge, struggles with real-world driving conditions, and cannot detect signal drift or new patterns (novelties) without manual reconfiguration. To address these challenges, Observer 3.0 is being developed using unsupervised artificial intelligence. This new version would offer autonomous, adaptive, and more scalable anomaly detection, while reducing human intervention and maintenance costs. The introduction raises two key hypotheses: that an AI model can improve detection by adapting to data changes, and that self-learning mechanisms can make the system more autonomous.
